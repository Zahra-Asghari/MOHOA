# MOHOA
## Multi-Objective Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm

Multi-objective optimization algorithms are used to solve optimization problems with multiple conflicting objectives. These algorithms aim to find a set of optimal solutions that represent a trade-off between the different objectives. The goal is to identify a set of Pareto optimal solutions, where no other solution can improve one objective without sacrificing another.

In this repository, you have implemented a multi-objective optimization algorithm called MOHOA (Multi-Objective Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm) based on the HOA (Horse Herd Optimization Algorithm). The HOA algorithm is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of horse herds to search for optimal solutions.

By extending the HOA algorithm to handle multi-objective optimization problems, the MOHOA algorithm enhances the search process to find a diverse set of Pareto optimal solutions. It incorporates mechanisms to balance exploration and exploitation, allowing the algorithm to converge towards the Pareto front of the problem.
